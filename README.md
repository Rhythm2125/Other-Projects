# Projects Domains Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Projects Domains** repository! This repository contains the domain definitions and models for various projects. It is designed to help separate the core business logic from other layers of the application. 

### Why are those repositories private?
Those repositories have been kept private due to **security** and **privacy concerns**. The domain models and business logic may contain sensitive information or proprietary algorithms that are not meant to be publicly accessible. 

However, you are welcome to **check out** and **explore** the repository to understand the structure of the domains and how they are organized for the respective projects. If you would like to collaborate or need access for specific purposes, please feel free to reach out to me directly.
